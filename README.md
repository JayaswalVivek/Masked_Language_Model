# Masked Language Model
This is a modification of the code published by HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-train) for training a masked language model (MLM). Since the original code uses older versions of libraries and functions (some which have now been deprecated), there was a need for a newer notebook and I hope that others find this code useful.
