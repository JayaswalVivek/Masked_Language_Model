# Masked Language Model
This is a modification of the code published by HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-train) for training a masked language model (MLM). Since the original code uses older versions of libraries and functions (some of which have now been deprecated), there was a need for newer code and I hope that others find this code useful. Further, to ensure that a user can execute all the steps using a free Google Colab account, only a subset of the original Esperanto data set is used for model training and testing.
